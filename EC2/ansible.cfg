# The configuration fileÔÉÅ
# Changes can be made and used in a configuration file which will be searched for in the following order:

# ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable if set)

# ansible.cfg (in the current directory)

# ~/.ansible.cfg (in the home directory)

# /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

# Ansible will process the above list and use the first file found, all others are ignored.
